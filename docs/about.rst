Commonly available qualitative colormaps have no more than 20 colours,
but for some applications it is useful to have many more colours that
are clearly different from one another. distinctipy can generate lists
of colours of any length, with each new colour added to the list being
as visually distinct from the pre-existing colours in the list as
possible. It can also be customised to take into account different
types of colourblindness, as well as providing utility functions such
as to select an appropriate font colour for any background colour.
