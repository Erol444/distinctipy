distinctipy is a lightweight python package providing functions to generate
colours that are visually distinct from one another.

Commonly available qualitative colormaps provided by the likes of matplotlib
generally have no more than 20 colours, but for some applications it is useful
to have many more colours that are clearly different from one another.
distinctipy can generate lists of colours of any length, with each new colour
added to the list being as visually distinct from the pre-existing colours in
the list as possible.
